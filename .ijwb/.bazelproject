# This is a projectview file generated automatically during bazel project auto-import 
# For more documentation, please visit https://ij.bazel.build/docs/project-views.html
# If your repository contains predefined .projectview files, you use 'import' directive to include them.
# Otherwise, please specify 'directories' and 'targets' you want to be imported
# 
# By default we keep your 'directories' and 'targets' sections empty, so nothing is imported.
# Please uncomment them and put the correct data there, and then run 'Sync' again

# directories: 
#  <your directory here>
# targets: 
#  <your directory here>
